## Simple Summary
This LEAP proposes to reduce incentives for GrantsDAO from $2500 / month paid in LYRA or USDC to $2000 / month, and reduce the number of seats on the Grants Council from 5 to 3. 

## Abstract
GrantsDAO to receive $2000 / month in LYRA or USDC, with 3 total seats from next epoch. 

## Motivation
The current structure is too costly, with the July-Nov epoch costing the DAO 350,000 LYRA tokens (1,050,000 LYRA annually). Whilst the work of GrantsDAO is important, the current cost basis is excessive. 

## Rationale
The original justification for $2,500/month centered around matching the Lyra Council. However, the Lyra Council deals with fundamental and technical protocol governance issues. GrantsDAO, whilst important, has a lower technical barrier for Council Members and a different set of role requirements. This alone justifies a difference in compensation rates.  

3 seats with relatively higher compensation should still support operational efficiency within Grants Council whilst keeping expenses reasonable. 

## Configurable Values 
From the beginning of the next epoch (March 2023), Lyra GrantsDAO members will receive the following each month: $2000 worth of LYRA, using the open price on coingecko on the first of each month. If this price is less than $0.05, the DAO may pay council members in USDC. The Council will have 3 members.
